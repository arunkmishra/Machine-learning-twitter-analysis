  <h1><strong>D.O.S.T</strong> (Detection of Online Spread of Terrorism)</h1>
  <div class="well">
  <p style="text-indent:justify">As considering the current scenario, Social media is being prominently used by various terrorist groups for promoting their motive. As social media is being widely used by the people so these groups are considering it as a great opportunity for spreading terrorism. It has been observed that a large number of terrorist activities have been co-ordinated using social media. The use of digital media has played a key role in their recruitment drive resulting in the recruitment of up to 20,000 foreign fighters — 1/10th of whom have come from Western countries (The Week). ISIS has used a variety of digital channels ranging from twitter to modeling games and even using drones to capture stunning video footage. The group has at least five media production organizations with translations in virtually all of the world’s major languages — including sign language (NBC). They have been able to produce such a high-volume of high-quality content due in part to rich coffers from the $2 billion a year they accrue from the sale of oil, tolls, sexual slavery, and taxes..</p>
